# Computer Vision and Robotics

A mostly Python code for a LEGO Mindstorm robot capable of exploring an unknown track made of Aruco markers, computing the most efficient path and running the whole trajectory in the shortest time possible.

The project was developed for the course Computer Vision and Robotics at the University of Goettingen, Germany, during the Erasmus winter semester 2023/24

The collaborators to the project are @tommasobertola @rtogni00 and @marcomartinico
